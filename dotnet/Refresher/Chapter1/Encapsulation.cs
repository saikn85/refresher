 * Encapsulation: refers to bundling the data (variables) and methods 
 * (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, 
 * called a class. 
 * 
 * It also involves restricting direct access to some of the object's
 * components, which is a means of preventing unintended interference 
 * and misuse of data.
 * 
 * Benefit(s): It helps in protecting the integrity of the data within 
 * an object, ensuring that it's accessed and modified only through 
 * well-defined interfaces (methods).
